From October 2022 till May 2023, me and my partner decided to take a career break and travel through South East Asia.

#### Singapore and Malaysia

We started our travels in Singapore to taste some of that Michelin rated hawker stalls and delicious kopi. After a couple of weeks, we then traveled to Malaysia to visit Kuala Lumpur and Penang in the north. Penang is in particular know for its delicous food, beatiful architecture and Char Koay Teow.

  {% endfor %}

#### Thailand and Cambodia

From Malaysia we took a boot to some of the islands on the west coast of Thailand. There is so many beautiful islands you can visit, I'd definitely recommend Koh Lipe or Koh Tao, with beautiful beaches and great diving spots. After all the sun and beaches we hit the road and traveled to Bangkok. It was great to be back in the city with all the foods you can think of, galleries, museums and so much more.

At this point, our visa was aproaching it's end, but there was still so much to see in Thailand. We decided to extend our stay and head to north of Thailand to see cities of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai. We couldn't miss on some of picturesque temples in the country.

After Thailand we traveled to Cambodia to see royal palace in its capital city of Phnom Penh and learn more about the brutal history of the country. We also had to go and see Siem Reap and Angkor Wat temples in the north, the eighth wonder of the world.

#### Vietnam and Taiwan

From Cambodia we head to Vietnam. At this point it's almost the end of the year so we figured we take a little break and stay in one place for a little while. We found this pet sit in Hoi An, in the central Vietnam. The town is beautiful even though is very popular with tourists, but it has some of the best banh mi we had in the whole of Vietnam.

We then fly north to Hanoi, which kind of became our base for various other trips. We go to Ha long bay for a cruise for a couple of days, we take a trip to Ha Giang on Chinese border, where we do motocycle tour through the countryside. We go to Sapa to see some mountains or Ninh Binh with its limestone peaks.

Throught the stay in Vietnam we try to learn more about the foods, coffee, various tribes and wars in Vietnam. It's a beatiful country with so much to see.

As a next stop we are planning to go to Japan, but it's still a little too cold so we pick Taiwan for a few weeks. This country was probably one of the biggest surprises. We didn't really plan to go there or knew much about it. But after a visit, I can't recommend this country enough. With beautiful country side, delicious food, easy to move around and some of the friendliest poeple, you have to visit this place.

#### Japan and South Korea

As a big fan of a ramen and sushi, I couldn't wait to come to Japan, and it really did not disappoint. From bustling Tokyo to traditional Kyoto, it's just a such a cool place to visit.
Everywhere we went we only had a great experience, and even with a language barrier, everyone we interacted with were nice and kind.

One of the most beautiful places we visited in Japan, was island of Naoshima. There are some of the most beautiful art galleries that I have ever seen and just spectacular country side. I can't recommend enough to anyone to visit this place.

Our last stop was South Korea. It turned out you can take a ferry from Fukuoka, Japan to Busan in South Korea, and after maybe 4 hours on a boat you end up in a modern city, with some nice beachs and plenty of sea food BBQ options.

We slowly made our way from south through Gyeongju, Andong and Gangneung all the way to Seoul, which was then our last stop.
